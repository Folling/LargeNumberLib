a library to handle very large Numbers for calculations

 1. **Already working :**
  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Multiplication
  * Division
  * Negative Values
  * operator.equals operators (e.g. += , -= ) 
  * increment operators;
  * Comparison of two numbers
  * access via [] operator
  * factorials
  * floating point number representation and addition for positive floating point numbers
  
 2. **Things to be implemented soon** 
  * The rest of the floating point numbers operators
  * Higher mathematical functions
  
 3. **Further plans for the future**
  * Namespaces like Decimal Binary and such to create a variety of largeNumbers
