a library to handle very large Numbers for calculations

 1. **Already working :**
  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Negative Values
  * Comparison of two numbers
  * operator.equals operators += and -= and *= 
  * increment operators;
  * multiplication
  
 2. **Did work, but was too slow so I'll have to completely warp it up**
  * division
  
 3. **Things to be implemented soon** 
  * the rest of the operator.equals operators
  * higher math functions (pow(); log(); etc.)
