a library to handle very large Numbers for calculations

 1. **Already working :**
  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Negative Values
  * Comparison of two numbers
  * operator.equals operators += and -= as well as *=
  * increment operators
  * multiplication
  * normal types (no floats or doubles) conversion to largeNumbers
   
 2. **Things to be implemented soon** 
  * division
  * thelast two operator.equals operators
  * higher math functions (pow(); log(); etc.)
  * floats and doubles, oh boy am I looking forward to this
  * proper commentation and code convention
