a library to handle very large Numbers for calculations

 1. **Already working :**
  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Multiplication
  * Division
  * Modulus
  * Negative Values
  * Comparison of two numbers
  * operator.equals operators (+=, -=, *=, /= and %=)
  * increment operators;
  
 2. **Things to be implemented soon** 
  * higher math functions (pow(); log(); etc.)
  
 3. **Things I basically don't want to work on but will implement at one point**
  * floating point numbers
