  - Comparison of two numbers
  - operator.equals operators += and -=
 - what currently works but with positive numbers only:
  - increment operators;
 - what currently doesn't work

 - what will be implemented 
  - division
  - the rest of the operator.equals operators
  - higher math functions (pow(); log(); etc.)
