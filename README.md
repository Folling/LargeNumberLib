a library to handle very large Numbers for calculations

 1. **Already working :**
  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Negative Values
  * Comparison of two numbers
  * operator.equals operators += and -= and *= 
  * increment operators;
  * multiplication;
  * factorials (up to 150 digits in 5 seconds, probably need to implement the Gamma Function for better results)
  
 2. **Things to be implemented soon** 
  * division
  * the rest of the operator.equals operators
  * higher math functions (pow(); log(); etc.)
