a library to handle very large Numbers for calculations

 **1. Already working :**
  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Negative Values
  * Comparison of two numbers
  * operator.equals operators += and -= as well as *=
  * increment operators;
  * multiplication
  
 **2. Somewhat working, still getting Exceptions at times :**
  * division
  * and thus the /= operator and the % and %= operators won't take long
  
 **3. To be implemented :** 
 * higher math functions (pow(); log(); etc.)
 * floating point numbers
