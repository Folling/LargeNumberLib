a library to handle very large Numbers for calculations

 1. **Already working :**
  * addition
  * subtraction
  * multiplication
  * division
  * negative Values
  * operator.equals operators (e.g. += , -= ) 
  * increment operators;
  * comparison of two numbers
  * access via [] operator
  * factorials
  * floating point number representation and operations
 2. **Things to soon be implemented**
  * floating point comparison and incrementation
  * higher mathematical functions
  
 3. **Further plans for the future**
  * Namespaces like Decimal Binary and such to create a variety of largeNumbers
  
  Please note, a few things are not yet very optimized, a precision of 1000 takes around 5 seconds for the floating point numbers to be     calcluated. Factorials could also be improved a little. I will add a proper documentation soon or soon-ish
